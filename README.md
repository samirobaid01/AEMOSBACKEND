# 🌿 AEMOS – Automated Environmental Monitoring & Operations System

## Overview

**AEMOS** is a real-time monitoring and control system designed for **smart hydroponic and aquaponic farming**. It enables growers and agricultural organizations to remotely monitor environmental parameters, control devices, receive automated alerts, and manage operational tasks efficiently.

This system is built to support **multi-organization setups**, allowing scalability across farms, greenhouses, or research facilities with hierarchical control and access.
